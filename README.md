**Fire Data Analysis and Prediction**
=============================================

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing and predicting fire data in Brazil. The project consists of three main components:

### 1. Data Processing

Loads and preprocesses the Brazilian fire dataset, providing functions to extract insights on fires per year, state, and month.

### 2. Data Visualization

Creates interactive plots to visualize the fire data, including total fires per year, state, and month.

### 3. Fire Prediction

Uses polynomial regression to predict future fires based on historical data.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* numpy

### Running the Analysis

1. Run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`

This will load the dataset, process the data, visualize the results, and predict future fires.

### Output

* The project will generate three plots:
	+ Total fires per year
	+ Total fires per state
	+ Total fires per month
* The prediction plot will show the actual fires per year alongside the predicted fires for future years.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
